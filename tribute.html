          <h3> Achievements</h3>
          <p> Marie Curie was a woman of firsts. She advanced not only science, but also women's place in the scientific community. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two of them, and the first of only two people to win
            a Nobel prize in two different fields (chemistry and physics, in her case). She coined the term "radioactivity," discovered two elements(Polonium and Radium) along with her husband Pierre Curie, and became the first female professor at the
            University of Paris.She also set up mobile Xray units during World War One and conducted studies into the treatment of tumors with radiation. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris and in Warsaw where her legacy lives on; both remain major
            centers of grounbreaking medical research today. </p>
